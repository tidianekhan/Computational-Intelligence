# Computational-Intelligence
Collection of projects accomplished during university course "Computational Intelligence" for the Bachelors of Science in Artificial Intelligence from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Projects include function optimization, image classification, Pytorch, Neural Networks and Evolutionary Algorithms. Files come in notebook form and .pdf. 

_**Assignment 1: Optimization**_

Goal: Get familiar with gradient-based and derivative-free optimization by implementing these methods
and applying them to a given function.
In this assignment we are going to learn about gradient-based (GD) optimization methods and
derivative-free optimization (DFO) methods. The goal is to implement these methods (one from each
group) and analyze their behavior. Importantly, we aim at noticing differences between these two
groups of methods.

_**Assignment 4: Neural Networks**_

Goal: Get familiar with neural networks by implementing them and applying them to image
classification.
In this assignment we are going to learn about neural networks (NNs). The goal is to implement
two neural networks: a fully-connected neural network, a convolutional neural network, and
analyze their behavior.
The considered task is image classification. We consider a dataset of small natural images (see
the additional file) with multiple classes. We aim at formulating a model (a neural network) and
learning it using the negative log-likelihood function (i.e., the cross-entropy loss) as the
objective function, and the stochastic gradient descent as the optimizer.
In this assignment, the code must be implemented in PyTorch.

_**Assignment 5: Neuroevolution**_

Goal: Implement an Evolutionary Algorithm to optimize an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
based controller for the CartPole task in OpenAI Gym environment.
CartPole evaluation environment functions are provided. Your goal is to implement your ANN to
control the cartpole and use your Evolutionary Algorithm to optimize the ANN parameters
(weights).
